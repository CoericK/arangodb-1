Docker:
    some progress has been made, challenges remaining:
      EXPOSE does not really open the ports, -p seems to still be needed 
        at runtime or at least --net=host
      address recognition does not work, since we get the IP addresses of the 
        Docker container
      data volumes not yet sorted
    in short: it does not work yet
      

future:
    shutdown via API instead of Kill
    observe subprocesses and potentially restart them as long as we are running
    configurable base ports
    free port testing?
    SSL
    authentication
